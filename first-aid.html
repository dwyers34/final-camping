  <section><h1>First Aid</h1></section>
  <header class="hero" id="banner">
    <p>This is just general first aid for common camping injuries. For major injuries, emergencies, or illness call 911 or a doctor. This should not be the only source of information for first aid and should not be relied on for everything.</p>
    <h2>Anaphylaxis</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Immediately call 911 or your local medical emergency number.</li>
      <li>Ask the person if he or she is carrying an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) to treat an allergic attack.</li>
      <li>If the person says he or she needs to use an autoinjector, ask whether you should help inject the medication. This is usually done by pressing the autoinjector against the person's thigh.</li>
      <li>Have the person lie still on his or her back.</li>
      <li>Loosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Don't give the person anything to drink.</li>
      <li>If there's vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn the person on his or her side to prevent choking.</li>
      <li>If there are no signs of breathing, coughing or movement, begin CPR. Do uninterrupted chest presses — about 100 every minute — until paramedics arrive.</li>
      <li>Get emergency treatment even if symptoms start to improve. After anaphylaxis, it's possible for symptoms to recur. Monitoring in a hospital for several hours is usually necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Minor Burns</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cool the burn to help soothe the pain. Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain eases. Or apply a clean towel dampened with cool tap water.</li>
      <li>Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells.</li>
      <li>Don't break small blisters (no bigger than your little fingernail). If blisters break, gently clean the area with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage.</li>
      <li>Apply moisturizer or aloe vera lotion or gel, which may provide relief in some cases.</li>
      <li>If needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).</li>
      <li>Consider a tetanus shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date. Doctors recommend people get a tetanus shot at least every 10 years.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>See your doctor if you develop large blisters. Large blisters are best removed, as they rarely will remain intact on their own. Also seek medical help if the burn covers a large area of the body or if you notice signs of infection, such as oozing from the wound and increased pain, redness and swelling.</p>
    <h2>Major Burns</h2>
    <p>Call 911 or emergency medical help for major burns. Until an emergency unit arrives, take these actions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Protect the burned person from further harm. If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not in contact with smoldering materials or exposed to smoke or heat. But don't remove burned clothing stuck to the skin.</li>
      <li>Check for signs of circulation. Look for breathing, coughing or movement. Begin CPR if needed.</li>
      <li>Remove jewelry, belts and other restrictive items, especially from around burned areas and the neck. Burned areas swell rapidly.</li>
      <li>Don't immerse large severe burns in cold water. Doing so could cause a serious loss of body heat (hypothermia) or a drop in blood pressure and decreased blood flow (shock).</li>
      <li>Elevate the burned area. Raise the wound above heart level, if possible.</li>
      <li>Cover the area of the burn. Use a cool, moist, bandage or a clean cloth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cuts and Scrapes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash your hands. This helps avoid infection. Also put on disposable protective gloves if they're available.</li>
      <li>Stop the bleeding. Minor cuts and scrapes usually stop bleeding on their own. If not, apply gentle pressure with a sterile bandage or clean cloth and elevate the wound.</li>
      <li>Clean the wound. Use clear water to rinse the wound. Also clean around the wound with soap and a washcloth. Keep soap out of the wound, as it can cause irritation. If dirt or debris remains in the wound after washing, use tweezers cleaned with alcohol to remove the particles. If debris still remains, see your doctor. Thorough cleaning reduces the risk of infection and tetanus. There's no need to use hydrogen peroxide, iodine or an iodine-containing cleanser, which can be irritating to tissue already injured.</li>
      <li>Apply an antibiotic. Apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment (Neosporin, Polysporin) to help keep the surface moist. These products don't make the wound heal faster. But they can discourage infection and help the body's natural healing process. Certain ingredients in some ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment.</li>
      <li>Cover the wound. Bandages can help keep the wound clean and keep harmful bacteria out. If the injury is just a minor scrape, or scratch, leave it uncovered.</li>
      <li>Change the dressing. Do this at least once a day or whenever the bandage becomes wet or dirty. If the injured person is allergic to the adhesive in tapes and bandages, switch to adhesive-free dressings or sterile gauze held in place with paper tape, rolled gauze or a loosely applied elastic bandage. These supplies generally are available at pharmacies.</li>
      <li>Get stitches for deep wounds. A deep — all the way through the skin — gaping or jagged wound with exposed fat or muscle will need stitches. Adhesive strips or butterfly tape may hold a minor cut together, but if you can't easily close the wound, see your doctor as soon as possible. Proper closure within a few hours minimizes scarring and reduces the risk of infection.</li>
      <li>Watch for signs of infection. See your doctor if the wound isn't healing or you notice any redness, increasing pain, drainage, warmth or swelling.</li>
      <li>Get a tetanus shot. If the injured person hasn't had a tetanus shot in the past five years and the wound is deep or dirty, he or she may need a booster shot, as soon as possible.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Fainting</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Position the person on his or her back. If the person is breathing, restore blood flow to the brain by raising the person's legs above heart level — about 12 inches (30 centimeters) — if possible. Loosen belts, collars or other constrictive clothing. To reduce the chance of fainting again, don't get the person up too quickly. If the person doesn't regain consciousness within one minute, call 911 or your local emergency number.</li>
      <li>Check the person's airway to be sure it's clear. Watch for vomiting.</li>
      <li>Check for signs of circulation (breathing, coughing or movement). If absent, begin CPR. Call 911 or your local emergency number. Continue CPR until help arrives or the person responds and begins to breathe.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Feeling Faint</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lie down or sit down. To reduce the chance of fainting again, don't get up too quickly.</li>
      <li>Place your head between your knees if you sit down.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fractures/Broken Bones</h2>
    <p>Don't move the person except if necessary to avoid further injury. Take these actions immediately while waiting for medical help:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stop any bleeding. Apply pressure to the wound with a sterile bandage, a clean cloth or a clean piece of clothing.</li>
      <li>Immobilize the injured area. Don't try to realign the bone or push a bone that's sticking out back in. If you've been trained in how to splint and professional help isn't readily available, apply a splint to the area above and below the fracture sites. Padding the splints can help reduce discomfort.</li>
      <li>Apply ice packs to limit swelling and help relieve pain. Don't apply ice directly to the skin. Wrap the ice in a towel, piece of cloth or some other material.</li>
      <li>Treat for shock. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, lay the person down with the head slightly lower than the trunk and, if possible, elevate the legs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Head Trauma</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep the person still. Until medical help arrives, keep the injured person lying down and quiet, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated. Don't move the person unless necessary, and avoid moving the person's neck. If the person is wearing a helmet, don't remove it.</li>
      <li>Stop any bleeding. Apply firm pressure to the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. But don't apply direct pressure to the wound if you suspect a skull fracture.</li>
      <li>Watch for changes in breathing and alertness. If the person shows no signs of circulation — no breathing, coughing or movement — begin CPR.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Heart Attack</h2>
    <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Uncomfortable pressure, fullness or squeezing pain in the center of the chest</li>
      <li>Discomfort or pain spreading beyond the chest to the shoulders, neck, jaw, teeth, or one or both arms, or occasionally upper abdomen</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
      <li>Lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting</li>
      <li>Sweating</li>
      <li>Nausea</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What to Do</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Call 911 or your local medical emergency number. Don't ignore or attempt to tough out the symptoms of a heart attack for more than five minutes. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have a neighbor or a friend drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort, and realize that it places you and others at risk when you drive under these circumstances.</li>
      <li>Chew and swallow an aspirin, unless you are allergic to aspirin or have been told by your doctor never to take aspirin. But seek emergency help first, such as calling 911.</li>
      <li>Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed. If you think you're having a heart attack and your doctor has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed. Do not take anyone else's nitroglycerin, because that could put you in more danger.</li>
      <li>Begin CPR if the person is unconscious. If you're with a person who might be having a heart attack and he or she is unconscious, tell the 911 dispatcher or another emergency medical specialist. You may be advised to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If you haven't received CPR training, doctors recommend skipping mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing and performing only chest compressions (about 100 per minute). The dispatcher can instruct you in the proper procedures until help arrives.</li>
      <li>If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available and the person is unconscious, begin CPR while the device is retrieved and set up. Attach the device and follow instructions that will be provided by the AED after it has evaluated the person's condition.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Insect Bites and Stings</h2>
    <h3>Mild</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Move to a safe area to avoid more bites or stings.</li>
      <li>If needed, remove the stinger.</li>
      <li>Wash the area with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Apply a cool compress. Use a cloth dampened with cold water or filled with ice. This helps reduce pain and swelling. If the injury is on an arm or leg, elevate it.</li>
      <li>Apply a cream, gel or lotion to the injured area. Use products containing ingredients such as hydrocortisone, pramoxine or lidocaine to help control pain. Use creams such as calamine lotion or those containing colloidal oatmeal or baking soda to help soothe itchy skin.</li>
      <li>Use over-the-counter medications. Try a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), or an antihistamine (Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, others).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Emergencies</h3>
    <p>In any emergency or possibility of emergency, it is best to call 911. If you are undure it is better to be safe than sorry.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask the person if he or she is carrying an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) to treat an allergic attack.</li>
      <li>If the person says he or she needs to use an autoinjector, ask whether you should help inject the medication. This is usually done by pressing the autoinjector against the person's thigh and holding it in place for several seconds.</li>
      <li>Loosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Don't give him or her anything to drink.</li>
      <li>Turn the person on a side to prevent choking if he or she is vomiting or bleeding from the mouth.</li>
      <li>Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sprains</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rest the injured limb. Your doctor may recommend not putting any weight on the injured area for 48 hours, so you may need to use crutches. A splint or brace may also be helpful initially. But don't avoid all activity. Even with an ankle sprain, you can usually still exercise other muscles to minimize deconditioning. For example, you can use an exercise bicycle with arm exercise handles, working both your arms and the uninjured leg while resting the injured ankle on another part of the bike. That way you still get three-limb exercise to keep up your cardiovascular conditioning.</li>
      <li>Ice the area. Use a cold pack, a slush bath or a compression sleeve filled with cold water to help limit swelling after an injury. Try to ice the area as soon as possible after the injury and continue to ice it for 15 to 20 minutes, four to eight times a day, for the first 48 hours or until swelling improves. If you use ice, be careful not to use it too long, as this could cause tissue damage.</li>
      <li>Compress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage. Compressive wraps or sleeves made from elastic or neoprene are best.</li>
      <li>Elevate the injured limb above your heart whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling.</li>
    </ol>
